There once was a nj transit train. It was known as the little train that couldn't. One fine day, for no discernable reason the train was delayed, of course.

Outside of Secaucus station the train was stopped, while all the other trains zipped on by.

What felt like many hours later the little train finally moved, delivering its passengers late as usual to Penn Station.
